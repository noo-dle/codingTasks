## Task 21 - Supervised learning - Random Forests.

_In this task, I used a Random Forest machine learning model in order to predict if a passenger survived the Titanic disaster._

### I broke down the Notebook into several sections:
1. Importing libraries and dataset
2. Selecting variables
3. Creating the base model
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Feature importance
6. Comparing models
7. The final chosen model with most optimal hyperparameters

For hyperparameter tuning for my Random Forest, I used the GridSearchCV method from scikit-learn.



#### Installation requirements to run this yourself:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
See the 'Importing libraries and dataset' section at the start of my Notebook for more details.
